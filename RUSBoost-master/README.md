RUSBoost
========

RUSBoost[1] is one of the most famous classification methods for imbalanced data.
I implemented this code as is in the publication[1]. However, some ideas to improve
a classification result have been proposed. For example, weak classifiers whose error
rates are over 0.5 should be removed. I have not implemented these ideas yet.

I welcome your feedback to improve this code.

Note
=======
This code can run with Python 2.6. For Python 3.6, this code needs some revisions.
